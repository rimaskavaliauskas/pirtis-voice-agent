  Comment for the design agent:
  This is a voice interview app for sauna design consulting. Two interview modes exist: Quick (3 
rounds × 3 questions batch) and Precise (single question with AI follow-ups). The Precise mode uses a state machine: idle → recording → processing → confirming → transitioning → idle. All content is stored in Lithuanian and translated on-demand. Key UX components: landing page with language selector, session page with audio recorder, results page with markdown report. Uses shadcn/ui + 
Tailwind with a dark glass-panel aesthetic.

  The README.md is just generic Next.js boilerplate - skip it.
